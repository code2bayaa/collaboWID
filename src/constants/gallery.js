I'm your host, CWIDPod and in each episode, we explore the intricate interplay of social, economic, environmental, legal, public participation and technological factors shaping the county's trajectory.

Our aim is not just to highlight challenges but to showcase the incredible efforts and innovations driving progress in Mombasa and Kenya as a whole.
